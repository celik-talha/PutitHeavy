# PutitHeavy
 This is a round based game that we have 6 pieces of each 1 10 20 and 50 points cubes. Players can put whatever cubes they want to the scales. At the end of the each round, player with the most points on the scales wins 1 score. While moving on to the next round, all points on the scales are being deleted. So you have to use your cubes carefully. The first player to reach 5 scores wins the game. Currently game is offline, so you are playing against AI. With the next updates 1v1 online mode will be supported.
